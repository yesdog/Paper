Subject: [PATCH] Don't recheck type after setting a block

The server does a "Did my update succeed" check after setting
a blocks data to a chunk.

However, writes can not fail outside of a hard error or a
a race condition from multiple threads writing, which is
not something that should ever occur on the server.

So this check is pointless, as if it did occur, the server would
be having data corruption issues anyways.

This provides a small boost to all setType calls.
